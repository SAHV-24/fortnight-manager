# Fortnightly Payment Manager

Fortnightly Payment Manager is an Angular application designed to help users manage and calculate recurring payments on a fortnightly basis. The application allows users to define payment concepts, calculate costs based on selected days, and manage payment periods. It is currently a static application using **LocalStorage** for data persistence but is structured to integrate with an API in the future for full CRUD functionality.

## Features

- **Payment Concept Management**: Create, edit, and delete payment concepts such as "Transport" or "Mom's Payment."
- **Cost Calculation**:
  - Calculate costs based on selected weekdays within a fortnightly period.
  - Calculate costs for weekends within a fortnightly period.
- **Customizable Frequency**: Define daily fixed costs and adjust the weekly frequency for each concept.
- **Fortnightly Periods**: Automatically generates two payment periods per month:
  - **1st Period**: From the 5th to the 19th of the month.
  - **2nd Period**: From the 20th to the 4th of the following month.
